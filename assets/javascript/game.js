//game with 4 crystals and they each have a unique randomly assigned value from 1 - 20
//there is a randomly assigned target score of 50 - 100

//each value adds to the previous selected value
//once the total is at or above the random target score, the game ends
//if the current score is equal to the target score, the player wins
//if the total score exceeds the target score, the player loses
//wins and loses should be tallied on screen, even when the game resets
